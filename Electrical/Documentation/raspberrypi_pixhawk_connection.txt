The raspberry pi and pixhawk connection was mainly done by using this tutorial
http://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/raspberry-pi-via-mavlink.html

Exceptions to the tutorial:
    the only exception was to use a baudrate of 57600 because anything above that would cause errors.
    the usb is configure as an eithenet port

little setup should be needed if you use the config files in raspi_config_files
